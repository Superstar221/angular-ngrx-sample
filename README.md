# OnlineStore

In order to show how to use @ngrx/store in Angular. To demonstrate the power of @ngrx/store, I built a simple "online store", that will allow users to do the following:

*See a list of products <br>
*View a particular product <br>
*Users can add a product to their cart <br>
*Users can delete a product from their cart <br>

## Development server

Clone the repository. <br>
Move into the directory. <br>
Run the ng serve command. <br>
Navigate to localhost:4200 in your browser. <br>
